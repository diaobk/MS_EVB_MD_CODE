 we encountered a strange bug compiling the similar MC code on pace.

testing against neat acetone and acetonitrile, all th energies are correct against old benchmarks
except the 3-body dispersion, which is way off
compiling with flags
OPT="-openmp -static -check bounds -check uninit -check format -warn declarations -traceback"
fixes this, not sure what the source of the problem is

so be careful with this compiled code...
